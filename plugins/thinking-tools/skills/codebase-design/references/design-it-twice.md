# Design It Twice

When exploring alternative interfaces for a module (or a deepening candidate), use this parallel-subagent pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout) — your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before spawning subagents, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [deepening.md](deepening.md))
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints — not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2. The user reads and thinks while the subagents work in parallel.

### 2. Spawn subagents

Spawn 3+ subagents in parallel using the Agent tool. Each must produce a **radically different** interface for the module. If the spikes need to write runnable code rather than sketches, give each agent `isolation: "worktree"` so they don't stomp each other.

Prompt each subagent with a separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from [deepening.md](deepening.md), what sits behind the seam). The brief is independent of the user-facing problem-space explanation in Step 1. Give each agent a different design constraint:

- Agent 1: "Minimize the interface — aim for 1–3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Agent 2: "Maximise flexibility — support many use cases and extension."
- Agent 3: "Optimise for the most common caller — make the default case trivial."
- Agent 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both the [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) vocabulary and the project's CONTEXT.md vocabulary (see [[domain-modeling]]) in the brief so each subagent names things consistently with the architecture language and the domain language.

Each subagent outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params — plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see [deepening.md](deepening.md))
5. Trade-offs — where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. If elements from different designs would combine well, propose a hybrid. Be opinionated — the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
